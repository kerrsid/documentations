It helps ensure that the code is carefully reviewed, tested, and improved before being merged into the master codebase. By following this flow, the company can maintain high-quality code and minimize the risk of introducing errors or issues in the final product.

1. **Developer makes changes:** The developer creates a new branch or checks out an existing branch in the version control system (e.g., Git) to work on a specific feature or bug fix.

2. **Develop and test locally:** The developer makes the necessary modifications to the codebase, implementing the desired feature or fixing the bug. They test the changes locally to ensure they are functioning as expected and do not introduce any regressions.

3. **Pull Request creation:** Once the developer is satisfied with their changes, they create a pull request (PR) in the version control system. The PR should include a clear title and description that explains the purpose of the changes.

4. **Reviewers assigned:** The development team or designated reviewers are assigned to review the pull request. The reviewers may include senior developers, team leads, or subject matter experts with knowledge of the specific application or domain.

5. **Code review process:** Reviewers carefully examine the code changes, looking for potential issues, bugs, or deviations from coding standards. They provide feedback, suggest improvements, and ask questions if something is unclear.

6. **Iterative improvements:** The developer addresses the feedback received during the code review process. They make the necessary adjustments, add missing documentation, and resolve any issues or concerns raised by the reviewers.

7. **Testing in staging:** The code changes that have been reviewed and iteratively improved are deployed to the staging environment for further testing. This allows comprehensive testing of the changes in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.

8. **Merge to staging:** The code is merged into the staging branch if the changes pass all the tests in the staging environment. This step involves integrating the changes with the existing codebase in the staging environment. This can be done using a CI/CD pipeline or a manual merge process.

9. **QA and user acceptance testing:** The QA team and relevant stakeholders thoroughly test the staging application to ensure all features and modifications work as expected. User acceptance testing (UAT) may also be conducted during this stage to gather feedback from end-users or clients.

10. **Feedback incorporation:** If any issues or feedback are identified during the QA and UAT phase, the developer makes the necessary changes, addressing any bugs or usability concerns.

11. **Create a pull request to master:** After the changes have been thoroughly tested in the staging environment and all feedback has been addressed, a new pull request is created to merge the changes from the staging branch to the master branch. This pull request includes a summary of the changes and their impact.

12. **Review and merge to master:** The pull request to merge the changes from staging to master is reviewed by the development team. Once approved, the changes are merged into the master branch, representing the production-ready code.

13. **Production deployment:** The merged code in the master branch is deployed to the production environment, making the new features or bug fixes available to end-users. This step can be automated through the CI/CD pipeline or done manually following established deployment procedures.

Once the changes have been validated in staging, a pull request is created to merge the changes into the master branch for further review and deployment to the production environment.
