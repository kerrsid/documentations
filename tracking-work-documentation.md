# **Why use tracking applications
Because of the new upcoming projects that will be this year, I chose to start tracking the time per *User Stories* and *Tasks*.

The goal for this tracking move is to start seeing the progress of our employees or collaborators and starting sending reports to the clients based on the maded work. The most important thing that this tool will help us with is that we will be able to start *very realistic estimates* on the work we will do.

# **What tool we will gonna use?**
Because no one has experience with this kind of tool and because we have multiple administration panels for our projects, we gonna use an external tool that will help us track multiple projects that we are working on with the possibility of linking them and filtering the tracking work. To achieve this need, we find out that the free subscription that **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com/)** has will fully satisfy our needs.

## Why **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com/)**
With TMetric, you can easily track time on tasks and projects, create time entries, capture billable hours, and save time on paperwork when it comes to generating time reports. Dive into a detailed overview of the time utilization and precisely evaluate productivity.

The benefits for the free plan are: 
- Time tracking 
- Unlimited projects and clients
- Reporting
- Timer button in 50+ web apps (Azure, Jira)

## How we gonna use the **TMetric** tool
To use the TMetric tool we will need to be invited to the Workspace named **Kerrsid Net**, for this one just talk with Sebi and tell him to not forget that you are new to the team and to invite you to the workspace.

Once you joined the workspace and see this dashboard:
