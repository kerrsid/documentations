# **Why use tracking applications as a multinational?**

Because of the new upcoming projects that will be this year I chose to start tracking the time per *User Stories* and *Tasks*.

The goal for this tracking move is to start seeing the progress of our employees or collaborators and starting sending reports to the clients based on the maded work. The most important thing that this tool will help us with is that we will be able to start *very realistic estimates* on the work we will do.

## **What tool we will gonna use?**

Because no one has experience with this kind of tool and because we have multiple administration panels for our projects we gonna use an external tool that will help us track multiple projects that we are working on with the possibility of linking them and filtering the tracking work. To achieve this need we find out that the free subscription that **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com/)** has will fully satisfy our needs.
